Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js is used around the world due to its performance, scalability, and flexibility. It's particularly popular for building applications that require real-time interaction and data processing.

# Express.js

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is an open source framework developed and maintained by the Node.js foundation.
Installation: Install the framework using the following command : npm install express

## Module used in backend
1. Nodemon :-

   The nodemon Module is a module that develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
   Nodemon does not require any change in the original code and method of development.
   Installation: Install the module using the following command : npm install -g nodemon
   
2. dotenv :-

   Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
   Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

### Library used in for backend
1. bcryptjs :-
   It's a JavaScript library that provides bcrypt hashing functions for passwords. Bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed to be slow and computationally intensive
   to make it resistant to brute-force attacks. It incorporates a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks and is considered a secure way to store passwords
   Installation: Install the library using the following command : npm install bcryptjs
   <br>
3. jsonwebtoken :-
    It provides an implementation for creating and verifying JWTs in Node.js applications. The jsonwebtoken library allows you to encode and decode JWTs, as well as sign and verify them using various algorithms
    Installation: Install the library using the following command : npm install jsonwebtoken
   <br>
4. mongoose :-
   Mongoose is indeed a JavaScript library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a powerful object data modeling (ODM) framework for MongoDB, allowing developers to interact with MongoDB databases using JavaScript objects
   and providing a schema-based approach for data modeling
   Installation: Install the library using the following command : npm install mongoose
   <br>
5. passport.js :-
    It is a library for authentication in Node.js applications. It is one of the most popular authentication middleware libraries available for Node.js. Passport.js provides a flexible and modular authentication framework,
   allowing developers to implement various authentication strategies, including username and password, social media logins (such as Facebook or Google), and more.
   Installation: Install the library using the following command : npm install passport


Here in this project I have used React+Vite for frontend

# Reactjs :-

<br>
Vite.js is a build tool and development server framework for creating modern web applications. It is particularly popular in the JavaScript ecosystem. Vite (pronounced "veet") is designed to optimize the frontend development experience by providing fast build times and a streamlined development environment
